## Lesson 3 Breakdown:
### What is saving?
Simply put, saving money means to not spend money. 
When it comes to money, you can either:
1. Spend all of it.
2. Save all of it.
3. Spend some of it and save some of it.
Instead of spending money unneccesarily, extra money not needed for immediate situations should be put aside for future use in a type of savings account.

### Why do we need to save?
It is important to know how to save money, so that you:
1. Won't spend all of your money every time you earn some.
- Example: Bobby gets paid $500 dollars every week and spends all his money every week on bills, shoes, and games. By the time Bobby gets paid again next week, he will have no money left over from his previous check. He will constantly have to work and wait on his next paychecks to have money to survive.
2. Set realistic goals and plans for your future to obtain things you need or want and to prepare for unforeseen events.
- Example: If Bobby saves just $100 out of the $500 he earns every week, Bobby could save $400 every month. If Bobby saves $400 every month from his paycheck for 5 months, Bobby will have saved and extra $2000 to use for emergencies or something that he really needs.
The more money you save, the more you can do.
