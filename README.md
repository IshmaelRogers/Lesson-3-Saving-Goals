It isn't your turn to talk UNLESS you are holding the "Talking Ball" and you can ONLY talk when you are holding the "Talking Ball" (which I will be holding the majority of the time).
No one is allowed to talk when someone else is talking.
2. Do not interrupt my class.
If you cause cause any disruption, you will have to first stand up.
If further disruption proceeds, student(s) will be removed from classroom.
Persistent disruption will lead to removal from the class.

-Examples:
1. Parents go to work for money.
2. Parents use money to purchase groceries from grocery story.

### Why do we use currency?
- In a nutshell, currency is used to acquire things you do not have. Whether you just want these things or actually need these things is a discussion for another day.

### How do we use currency? (Exchange Systems)
- People used to exchange goods and services for things they did not have or things that they wanted. 
- Examples:

- As time moved on, the exchange systems remained the same, but the items exchanged began to change.

2. Dollars
3. Loans
- Though times have changed since earlier exchange systems have been developed, some items still have managed to retain value.
- Examples: 
1. Silver
2. Platinum
3. Gold.

### How do we earn currency? (Entrepreneurship)
- Currency doesn't just accumulate on its own. You have to go out and make it. How you do that is up to you.
- Examples:
1. Entrepreneurship- "Invent" a pair of shoes or become a business owner.
2. Talents- Become a basketball player or engineer.
- There are numerous ways to earn currency, but the most important takeaway is that there is always an exchange system with any type of currency.

2. You can sell candy after school to your peers for cash.
3. You could have a really amazing career years from now that comes with a company car, phone, house, and a big check.
