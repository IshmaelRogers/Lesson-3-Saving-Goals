## Lesson 3 Breakdown:
### What is saving?
Simply put, saving money means to not spend money. 
When it comes to money, you can either:
1. Spend all of it.
2. Save all of it.
3. Spend some of it and save some of it.
Instead of spending money unneccesarily, extra money not needed for immediate situations should be put aside for future use in a type of savings account.

### Why do we need to save?
It is important to know how to save money, so that you:
1. Won't spend all of your money every time you earn some.
- Example: Bobby gets paid $500 dollars every week and spends all his money every week on bills, shoes, and games. By the time Bobby gets paid again next week, he will have no money left over from his previous check. He will constantly have to work and wait on his next paychecks to have money to survive.
2. Set realistic goals and plans for your future to obtain things you need or want and to prepare for unforeseen events.
- Example: If Bobby saves just $100 out of the $500 he earns every week, Bobby could save $400 every month. If Bobby saves $400 every month from his paycheck for 5 months, Bobby will have saved and extra $2000 to use for emergencies or something that he really needs.
The more money you save, the more you can do. 

### How can we save money?
Fortunately for you, saving money is easy and you can start saving money today! There are plenty of methods and strategies to saving money and knowing about them will allow you to make responsible decisions with your money.
**Method 1: Set Savings Goals!**
1. *Identify what you would like to save for.* This could be anything at all, but most importantly, it is something that you would like to have and cannot reasonably afford to purchase at the moment.
2. *Identify how much you would need to save in order to obtain what is that you are saving for.* 
-For instance, if Brittney wants to save for a new PS4 gaming system, she would need to identify the cost of how much the game system, the controllers if they are not included, and the games for playing if they are not included.
3. *Identify when you need or would like to have the money by.* If you need to save $200 dollars in two weeks, you could save $100 per week, $50 twice a week, or $14.29* a day.
Executing this method will allow you to decide how you would like to go about saving you money. Just by repeating these 3 steps for each item you would like to save, you will be able to create realistic and achievable savings goals to work towards. 

**Method 2: Save FIRST, Spend LAST.**
- Example: Everyone earned +1000 points (money) just by being present in class today. By show of hands,
1. Would you spend it on all the toys and candy you want? 
2. Would you save some of it to buy things another day and buy a little something with the rest of it today?
3. Would you save it all and wait to purchase something you really want another day?
The purpose of this method allows for you to take your financial goals and plans into consideration first, not your immediate desires. This ensures that you make steady progress towards achieving your goals and always keep your plans in the front to be executed properly.

**Method 3: Cut Expenses; Budget your money.**
The purpose of a budget is to help eliminate unnecessary expenses and hidden costs. Understanding and knowing how much money you earn and spend consistenly is very crucial to making a budget. By getting your savings organized, you can really make the extra money you save work for you. To create a budget:
1. Identify all of your sources of income. This can be your allowance, earnings from your small business, etc.
2. Identify all of your expenses and costs. This can be paying for lunch, buying snacks every day, etc.
3. Identify all other wants and needs. This can include emergency funds, savings goals, etc.
With these components, you will be able to look at how much money you bring in and how much money goes out. From there, you will be able to make sound financial decisions knowing where you are financially and what goals you're trying to achieve.

### Why is it important to know?
- This is important to know because,
1. If you don't know how money works, you will spend your life working for money.
2. By understanding the power of money, you gain power over it.
3. It's better to start saving now; the sooner, the better. If you saved $1 a day, you could save $7 a week, $30 a month, and possibly $360 in a year with discipline and determination. 
4. Financial freedom is a choice and soon that choice will be yours!

## Learning Activity 1: Short- and Long-Term Goals
### Objective: 
Students will identify different types of Short- and Long-Term Goals.

### Strategy:

2. Each student will be randomly selected to suggest one thing that they would like to save for or something that would be generally saved for.
3. The student making the suggestion will be asked if they think it is a ST or LT goal.
3. Each suggested will be added to the appropriate category with a brief explanation of the reason why that category was chosen.

### Rules:
1. Each suggestion is worth +1000 points.
2. Only one suggestion per student. However, students can assist stuggling classmates with ideas for no additional points.
3. Goals are to be classified ST if they are achievable within 5 months of goal settings; LT if they are achievable withing 6 or more months.

2. Each team will be giving a front and back "Yes/No" card or poster.
3. Each tactic scenario will be called out and teams will have to decide whether the tactic caused influential spending.

### Rules:
1. One facilitator from each team will be chosen to represent the group. (To hold up the poster card.)
2. Once the scenario has been given, students will have up to 1 minute to decide if the tactic caused influential spending.
3. Each correct answer is worth +1000 points.
4. The only extra talking allowed is during the deliberation moment for the correct answer.

#### Teachers Note
-Take notes on official roster for points earned or lost by students. This will be needed for Lesson 5 to have an accurate account of "money earned" by each student.
